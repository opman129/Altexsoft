# Altexsoft Test task for the Technical writer position

Working as a technical writer, your goal would be to research, analyze, organize, and put in writing
the approaches, methodologies, and algorithms for implementing specific technical tasks. As most
of the knowledge we gather and organize relates to the travel industry, the majority of your writing
will relate to the travel industry as well. So, in order for you to get a feel for your future job and for
us to get a sense of the results we may expect from you, we’d like to ask you to complete this
assignment below.

## Task

Please describe the **Get Booking** method for the Sabre Booking Management API by explaining the
following:

• what is this method?
• reasons to use it
• main steps the method performs (present in the form of a diagram)
• basic requests and responses (display booking, display booking and validate surname,
display selected booking elements)
• examples of request and response parameters
• possible errors returned by the method, their categories, and descriptions.

## What we’ll be looking for in the final document

• simple, practical language; partially educational, partially informational style of writing;
• clear structure of the document and accurate content;
• proper formatting and layout for easy readability;
• visual content: diagrams, flows, screenshots, samples of code, etc.;
• a set of links referencing sources.

The target audience for the document is Software Developers with entry-level experience in the
travel technology industry. While the final result should be a piece of technical writing, we expect it
to, first of all, be an example of excellent writing that is easy to read, which, as it so happens, also
describes a complex technical concept.

Let us know should you have any questions while completing the task.
